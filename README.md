Code Style Validation with GitHub Actions
This repository demonstrates how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically validates code style for Java and Python files. The workflow uses Checkstyle for Java files and Pylint for Python files to ensure proper code formatting, including indentation and other style violations.

The workflow is triggered on every pull request and push to the main branch.

Features
Checkstyle for Java: Enforces Google Java Style Guide.
Pylint for Python: Enforces PEP 8 style guide.
GitHub Actions: Automatically runs code style validation on pull requests and pushes to the main branch.
